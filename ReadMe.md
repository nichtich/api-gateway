# NFDI Federated Search Service

## Overview

The NFDI Federated Search Service is an advanced, dynamic solution designed to perform federated searches across multiple databases containing ontologies. It is particularly tailored for environments where integration and aggregation of diverse data sources are essential. The service offers faceted search capabilities, enabling users to refine search results based on specific criteria, and supports responses in both JSON and JSON-LD formats.

A standout feature of this service is its dynamic nature, governed by a YAML configuration file. This design choice allows for easy extension and customization of the service to include new databases or modify existing configurations.

## Features

- **Federated Search Across Multiple Databases:** Seamlessly query multiple databases simultaneously and aggregate results into a unified format.
- **Faceted Search Capabilities:** Filter and refine search results based on specific criteria, enhancing the search experience and relevance of results.
- **Dynamic Configuration:** Utilize a YAML file to configure database connections and response mappings, enabling easy addition or modification of data sources.
- **Response Format Flexibility:** Choose between standard JSON and JSON-LD formats for search results, catering to different use cases and requirements.
- **Schema Transformation:** Convert search responses into specific database schemas, facilitating integration with various database-driven systems.

## Extensibility and Customization

The service's dynamic configuration approach allows for straightforward extensibility. Adding a new database or modifying an existing one involves updating the YAML configuration file with the relevant details and mappings. This flexibility ensures that the service can adapt to evolving data sources and requirements without the need for significant code changes.

## Getting Started

To start using the service, configure the desired databases and their response mappings in the YAML file. The service will handle the rest, from querying the databases to transforming and returning the aggregated results.

## Conclusion

The NFDI Federated Search Service is a powerful tool for organizations and projects that require advanced search capabilities across multiple ontology databases. Its dynamic nature, combined with the ability to transform responses to specific schemas, makes it a versatile and valuable asset in any data-driven environment.
